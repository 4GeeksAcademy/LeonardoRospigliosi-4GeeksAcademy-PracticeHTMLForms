# `03` Type Radio 

The `input type=radio` is used when the user is not allowed to pick more than one option.

To bind different radios into the same group of options you need to assign them the same name.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create 2 input `type=radio` to pick the sex values: Male or Female.

2. Create another 2 input `type=radio` to pick sexual orientation: Heterosexual or LGBTI.

## 💡 Hints:

+ Search about `<input>` and `<label>` tags.

+ Test your form, only one gender and one sexual orientation should be allowed to pick.
