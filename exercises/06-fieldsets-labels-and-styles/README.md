# `06` Fieldsets, labels and styles

Styling a form is boring and tedious, but if you use certain tags, your life can be easier. 

`<label>`: One of the typical things you need to do is add a "label" to your input, labels tell the end-user what the input stands for.

`<fieldset>`: They are ideal to add several inputs into the same logical group (for example grouping radios -male and female- into a gender fieldset).

`<legend>`: It's the name of the fieldset group that is going to be shown to the end-user.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Give style to this form by applying to the body:

```css
font-family: "Lato", sans-serif;
```

2. Remove `borders` and `margins` from all the fieldsets. 

3. Apply a `padding` of `10px` to the top and bottom and a `padding` of `0px` to the left and right to all the fieldsets. 

4. Apply a `font-weight` of `800` to all the fieldsets.

5. Decrease the `font-weight` off all the labels to `400`.

6. Add a `width` of `500px` to the form element.

7. Apply these rules to all the text inputs:

```css
input[type=text] {
	border: none;
	border-bottom: 1px solid black;
	font-size: 16px;
}
```

8. Apply this style to the submit button:

```css
input[type=submit] {
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #f65252;
  color: white;
  width: 100%;
}
```
