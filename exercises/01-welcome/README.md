# `01` Welcome to the world of HTML 😆 !!

Hello, my name is [Alejandro Sánchez](http://alesanchezr.com), and I'm one of the founders of @4GeeksAcademy. These exercises and many other interactive tutorials have been open sourced and released through the [4Geeks Website](https://4geeks.com).

These exercises are for anyone interested in mastering HTML Forms, we will go over the following concepts:

1. Using text inputs, text areas, date inputs and numeric inputs

2. Using dropdowns

3. Form preventive validations

4. Styling a form

## ➡️ Incremental & ✔️ Autograded

- I've built the exercises incrementally, you should feel the progress little by little, and hopefully, the difficulty raising between exercises will never be too big to get you frustrated.

- All exercises have been automatically graded thanks to [@haydavid23](https://github.com/haydavid23)
