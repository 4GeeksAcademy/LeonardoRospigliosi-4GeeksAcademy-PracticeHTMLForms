# `07` Style without ID or Class

Here you have a beautiful signup form, you can read the code to understand how it was made.

## üìù Instructions:

Replace all the `.class` and `#id` selectors from `index.html` with other types of selectors to accomplish the same reference. For example:

For this HTML:

```html
<div><a class="myAnchor">Here is an anchor</a></div>
```

Instead of doing:

```css
.myAnchor { background: red; }
```

You could do:

```css
a { background:red; }
```

The only class selector you can keep using is `.active`

At the and your form needs to look exactly the same as the original one, like this:
