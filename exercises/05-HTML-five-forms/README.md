# `05` HTML Form

HTML5 brings some more cool tricks to forms, here is a few:

- We are using placeholders to help the user understand how to fill each specific input.

- There is now an input `type=email`, use it on the form.

- There is now an input `type=tel`, use it on the form for the phone number.

- There is now an input `type=url`, use it on the form for the website

- You can use the `required` attribute to make it mandatory. Apply the `required` attribute to the email only (the form won't submit until is not complete).

- Using the `autofocus` attribute it will focus the cursor in that particular input when the website loads. Apply the `autofocus` attribute to the email.
